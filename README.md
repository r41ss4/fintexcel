# About
This project involves calculating Price Level Indicators (PLIs) for a group of nine fintech companies. The PLIs calculated include:

* Return on Sales (ROS)   
* Gross Profit to Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (GP to EO)   
* Income from Operations to Total Capital (IO to TC)   
* Gross Margin Per Unit (GMPU)     
  
The data for these calculations was extracted from the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://www.sec.gov/) website and consists of raw financial data from nine fintech companies.

## Concepts and calculations
*  **Price Level Indicators:** Comparative price level indices are the ratios of purchasing power parities to market exchange rates. At the level of GDP, comparative price levels provide a measure of the differences in the general price levels of countries [(OECD, n.d.)](https://www.oecd.org/en/data/indicators/price-level-indices.html).        
*  **Return on Sales (ROS):** Operating Income / Sales     
*  **Gross Profit to Operating Expense (GP to EO):** Gross Profit / Operating Expense      
*  **Operating Income to Total Costs (IO to TC):** Operating Income / Total Costs      
*  **Gross Profit MarkUp (GMPU):** Gross Profit / Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
